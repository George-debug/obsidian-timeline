Use `+` at the begining of each line:

- each event has 3 `+` at the beging of the line for time, title and description
- you can separate them with empty lines if it's easier for you to write

Use `[]` at the begining of the code-block to add pre-written classes or your own classes to the wrapper. The list of all pre-written classes:

- **white**/**black** changes the main vertical line and dashed line to white/black
- **spaced-paragraph** increases the default line-height of description's paragraphs
- The description of each event can do everything Obsidian.md can do
